    <Tool title="14” InfinityBook S14 - Gen6">
      My personal computing device. I mostly use it for some lightweight
      browsing or the occasional personal project. It has an Intel Core
      i7-1165G7, 40Gb's of RAM and a 1TB SSD. I solely run Linux on this device,
      my main OS of choice is Arch Linux!
    </Tool>
    <Tool title="14” Apple M3 Pro, 36GB RAM (2023)">
      My corporate-issue battle station is a 14” MacBook Pro (2023) with an M3
      Pro and 36 GB of RAM. macOS isn’t exactly my natural ecosystem, so I strip
      it down to the essentials. I run Aerospace as my tiling window manager to
      wrestle macOS into something that behaves like a real workstation. Beyond
      that it’s mostly terminals, browsers, and the tooling I need to get code
      shipped no fancy Mac apps, no glossy workflows, just the basics wired
      together so I can stay productive.

    <Tool title="Logitech MX Master 3S, Wireless Mouse">
      For the longest time, I was using an Apple Magic Mouse. I got it for free,
      so why not use it? I only cared a little about input devices, so I stuck
      with the Apple mouse or the trackpad on my laptop. But boy did I miss out;
      this Logitech mouse is an absolute joy to use.
    </Tool>
    <Tool title="Keychron K8 Pro, Mechanical Keyboard">
      This is my first mechanical keyboard ever and is a real joy to type on.
      I've got the ISO UK layout with Pre-lubed Gateron G Pro Brown switches.

  <ToolsSection title="Development tools">
    <Tool title="NeoVim">
      My editor of choice, and honestly the tool I probably spend the most hours
      inside. I run a heavily tuned Neovim setup with custom plugins, LSP
      integration, treesitter, and a bunch of quality-of-life tweaks baked into
      my dotfiles. Whether I’m doing quick edits or full project work, Neovim
      loads instantly and behaves exactly the same across macOS and Linux, which
      makes hopping between machines completely frictionless. It’s fast,
      scriptable, predictable — basically everything I want in an editor. Look
      at my

      > for a little peek at my configuration.
    </Tool>
    <Tool title="Tmux">
      This is the backbone of my terminal workflow. I pretty much live inside
      tmux sessions all day — split panes everywhere, long-running processes
      tucked into background windows, and a handful of permanent sessions that
      survive reboots and context switches. Thanks to my <a
        href="https://github.com/vandycknick/dotfiles/.config/tmux"
        class="font-medium text-teal-500">dotfiles</a
      > , tmux lands on any machine I touch (macOS or Linux) with my full setup:
      keybindings, plugins, catppuccin colors, the whole thing.

  <ToolsSection title="Productivity">
    <Tool title="Obsidian">
      I've used many note-taking apps, from OneNote to Notion, over the years.
      Nowadays, I've settled on Obsidian. I love the simplicity it brings to
      note-taking and allowing my notes to stay private. It's my new second
      brain!
